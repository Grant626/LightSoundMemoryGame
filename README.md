Submitted by: Grant Fairfield

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

TODO: Allow the computer to randomly generate patterns (different pattern lengths as well) and allow the user to select different dificulties that will result in more difficult patterns.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

  I used the website https://www.w3schools.com/ to help me understand various basic javascript functionality and CSS attributes.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  The biggest challenge I faced throughout completing this submission would be learning about the provided JavaScript functions and implementing JavaScript with        HTML/CSS. I have some knowledge about HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and JavaScript but learning how to make the website elements functions with JavaScript logic was more difficult than I thought. For instance, it was difficult for me to comprehend how the playSequence() could continue to play the pattern based on the guessCounter and progress variables.  I was able to utilize various educational websites like w3schools.com and stack overflow to help me understand how the functionality of a website is built with JavaScript. From 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  Completing this submission sparked some of my curiosity about web developemt, speficially about how advanced features would work. For instance, I am curious how video streaming platforms like YouTube work to allow the streaming of videos possibly stored in a cloud. I am also curious how social media platforms are able to allow connections between devices and accounts with messaging and photo sharing. One area I also hope to learn more about is web3 applications and how blockchain technology works over the web.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  Some main features that I would add would be to allow the computer to randomly generate patterns for the user and to allow the user to change the difficulty of the pattern. I would also possibly allow the user to have a score kept based on the time it took to complete the game, and then record their scores so that they can try and beat their high score.
